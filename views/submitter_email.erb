Dear <%= proposal.name %>,

Thank you for submitting your talk, "<%= proposal.title %>", to JRubyConf 2012!

As of this moment, the call-for-proposals continues through <%= SUBMISSION_DEADLINE %>.
You have until midnight US Central Daylight Time that day to edit your
proposal or add additional proposals.

You can view, edit or withdraw your proposal at the following URL:

<%= proposal_url(proposal.key) %>


You can share this URL with collaborators but please keep the URL private. We
reserve the right to refuse your proposal if we find it posted in a public forum
before the full schedule of talks are announced.

Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of speaking slots in this
years' conference program. You can certainly submit as many talks as you like,
but we will probably only accept one talk per speaker.

Thanks again, and we hope to see you in May!

The JRubyConf team (Kelsey, Elaine, Flannery, and Nick)
