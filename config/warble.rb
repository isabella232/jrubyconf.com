  # MANIFEST.MF that contains the version of Warbler used to create the war file.

  # files will be compiled. Default is to compile all \.rb files in

  # === War files only below here ===

  # Path to the pre-bundled gem directory inside the war file. Default
  # is 'WEB-INF/gems'. Specify path if gems are already bundled
  # before running Warbler. This also sets 'gem.path' inside web.xml.
  # config.gem_path = "WEB-INF/vendor/bundler_gems"

  # Files for WEB-INF directory (next to web.xml). This contains
  # web.xml by default. If there is an .erb-File it will be processed
  # with webxml-config. You may want to exclude this file via
  # config.excludes.

  # When using the :rack booter, "Rackup" script to use.
  # - For 'rackup.path', the value points to the location of the rackup
  # script in the web archive file. You need to make sure this file
  # gets included in the war, possibly by adding it to config.includes
  # or config.webinf_files above.
  # - For 'rackup', the rackup script you provide as an inline string
  #   is simply embedded in web.xml.
  # The script is evaluated in a Rack::Builder to load the application.
  # Examples:
  # config.webxml.rackup.path = 'WEB-INF/hello.ru'
  # config.webxml.rackup = %{require './lib/demo'; run Rack::Adapter::Camping.new(Demo)}
  # config.webxml.rackup = require 'cgi' && CGI::escapeHTML(File.read("config.ru"))

  # Control the pool of Rails runtimes. Leaving unspecified means
  # the pool will grow as needed to service requests. It is recommended
  # that you fix these values when running a production server!
  # If you're using threadsafe! mode, you probably don't want to set these values,
  # since 1 runtime(default for threadsafe mode) will be enough.
  # config.webxml.jruby.min.runtimes = 2
  # config.webxml.jruby.max.runtimes = 4

  # JNDI data source name
  # config.webxml.jndi = 'jdbc/rails'
