## Venue

All conference workshops and sessions will take place at the Guthrie Theater on
818 South 2nd Street.

The Guthrie is a gorgeous, expansive complex that we
[encourage you to explore](http://www.guthrietheater.org/about_guthrie/our_spaces).
The lobbies are considered public spaces, so if you need to step away from
festivites, you are welcome to lounge wherever you like. Wi-fi is available
throughout the facility. We also have [a map of the facilities][guthriemap]
available.

### Classrooms

Monday workshops will take place in the level eight classrooms. Proceed to
either the lobby escalators or elevator to level four. If taking the escalator,
turn about face at the top, walk back toward the front of the building, and take
the elevator on your left to level eight. If taking the lobby elevator, exit the
elevator at level four, walk across to the other elevator, and take it to level
eight.

We also have the classrooms available on Tuesday and Wednesday for meetings,
quiet work, or breakout sessions. They are accessible from the Dowling Studio by
taking the stairs in the studio lobby down one level.

### Dowling Studio

All conference sessions will take place in the Dowling Studio on level nine.
From the street level lobby, proceed as for the classrooms except take the last
elevator to level nine.

### Restrooms

The closest restrooms to the conference area are located on level eight by the
classrooms.

### Food On-site

Due to our catering contract with the Guthrie, we are not allowed to bring in food
from outside the premises. If you want to grab a quick bite to eat, check out
the [Level Five Express][] on (you guessed it) level five.

## Breakfast

Breakfast, coffee/drinks and snacks will be served in the Dowling Studio lobby
on level nine.

## Lunch

Lunch will be served off the Guthrie site both days to give you a chance to get
out and enjoy the fresh air.

### Tuesday

Tuesday lunch is located in the **Day Block Building** (corner of 11th and
Washington) on the second floor (above [Spill the Wine][] and next to
[Grumpy's][]).

[Six One Two 'Cue](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Six-One-Two-Cue/130557033639321)
is going to load us up with some home cooked BBQ midwestern style. Lest ye worry
about vegetarian- and vegan-unfriendly BBQ, rest assured that we will have tasty
options for you too.

of what was once the world's largest flour mill. We've arranged for you to visit
the museum free of charge! Just show your conference badge to the ticket desk in
the gift shop. Anytime after 2pm is best in order to avoid the school field trip
crowds. Have fun!
