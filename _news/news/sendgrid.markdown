# SendGrid

JRubyConf 2012 is a tech conference in Minneapolis produced by Engine
Yard, Inc., 

JRubyConf is planning on using SendGrid to deliver emails to
speakers to confirm we received their proposals. We may also use
SendGrid to email attendees once we consolidate email lists from our
event registration site.

I actually received an inquiry from Tim Falls at SendGrid a while back
about sponsoring JRubyConf. At the time we did not have our
sponsorship information fully developed. Now I find myself in the
position to actually be using SendGrid for the conference itself.
Perhaps we can revisit the sponsorship discussion?

Thanks,
