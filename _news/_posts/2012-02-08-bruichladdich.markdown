What's that you say? Unusual that a tech conference in the Upper
Midwest of the U.S. would be sponsored by a whisky distillery in
Scotland? We wholeheartedy agree!

Bruichladdich hail themselves as [Progressive Hebridean Distillers][progressive].
Looking a little deeper, Minnesota is a progressive state, and JRuby is a
progressive piece of technology. So we think we're actually a great
match for each other. When award-winning whisky meets great tech, we all win!

This marks the [third][2010] [annual][2011] whisky tasting event at
JRubyConf, and we're fortunate to have [Craig Johnstone][] (aka
[@WhiskyCraig][]) join us once again. Craig's natural storytelling
prowess will entertain even those of you who are not (yet!) whisky
fans.

And how about that name&mdash;Bru-huh? Bruichladdich, one of the
[fifty most unpronounceable names in Scotland][name], can be spoken
for now as simply "Brook-Laddie". Rest assured that you'll get a crash
course in proper Scottish pronunciation during the tasting.

We're overjoyed to welcome Bruichladdich as a sponsor of JRubyConf
2012, and we hope you'll join in our enthusiasm by [reserving your place][register]
at this years' whisky tasting!
