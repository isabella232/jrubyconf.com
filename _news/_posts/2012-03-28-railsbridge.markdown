## Free RailsBridge Community Workshop

We're pleased to announce a very special [RailsBridge workshop][rbwk] at
JRubyConf! For those who don't know, a RailsBridge workshop is a free, two-day
outreach event targeted at women who want to learn to program. We're also
delighted to welcome [Sarah Allen][] to Minneapolis to lead the workshop. We
will be taking you through every step in the process of deploying a Ruby on
Rails application. Men are invited as guests of women attending. We are also
looking for volunteers with programming experience!

[**Register now for the workshop, it's free!**][register]

This program was started about three years ago by Sarah Allen and
Sarah Mei, as part of a greater mission to create more female Ruby
developers in San Francisco (and beyond). To find out more about
RailsBridge workshops, visit [workshops.railsbridge.org][rbwk].

Did we mention that the cost of the workshop is free? [Go get registered!][register]
