Welcome to the official site of the 2012 JRuby Conference! We’ll be
using this platform as a way to keep you up to date with conference
developments and details as they unfold. This will be the fourth
annual JRubyConf and definitely the biggest and best yet! Join us in
talking about and celebrating the union of the Java and Ruby
communities. Follow this blog to find out more about sponsorships,
speakers, after-events and a soon-to-follow call-for-proposals. Also
stay tuned for more information about Workshop Day (Monday the 21st)
and the [conference schedule][schedule] (Tuesday & Wednesday the 22nd
& 23rd).

This year’s JRubyConf will take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, home
to some of JRuby’s main contributors and biggest cheerleaders, at the
Guthrie Theater on the banks of the mighty Mississippi.

Want to support our cause? We're currently looking for sponsors for
everything from snacks to after-parties, so check out our [prospectus][]

other cool ideas. We'd love to see your participation.

Want to join us? [Buy your tickets now][register]. Can't wait to see
you all there!
