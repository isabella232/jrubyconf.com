title: KidsCodeCamp at JRubyConf!
---
Did you ever want to make a video game, program a robot, or create a
web site? Now you can!

Come to KidsCodeCamp, a free one-day event to learn how to use
computers and technology to make things that do whatever you want, and
we're so happy that [Ron Evans](https://twitter.com/deadprogram) is
teaching it at JRubyConf this year.

[**Register now for KidsCodeCamp!**][kccmn]

Here is how it works:

1. Local volunteers will run classes intended for a particular age
   group (elementary, middle, or high-school age kids). Each class is
   from 1 to 2 hours long.
2. Kids and volunteers register for free, just so everyone knows how
   many people will be coming.
3. Everyone has fun on the day of KidsCodeCamp!

**YOU MUST BRING A PORTABLE COMPUTER TO ATTEND! Does not matter which
kind, PC or MAC... SORRY NO iPADS/iPODS.**

(Don't have a portable computer but still want to attend? [Contact
us][contact] and we'll see what we can do for you. We are working on
obtaining a small supply of computers to have available for kids who
can't bring a computer.)

Each kid will receive a free USB drive with Open Source* software to
use at KidsCodeCamp. Afterwards, they can be used at home, school, or
wherever.
