title: Call For Proposals
---
We're very pleased to announce that the [JRubyConf call for papers is
officially open][proposals]. While we're certainly looking for great
stories about how you're winning using JRuby, we also won't mind a
couple of proposals that fall outside the JRuby-sphere. If you feel
passionate and want to speak about a project or topic that you think
suits the mix of people that will be at JRubyConf, let us hear about
it! We're looking forward to a great event and can't wait to see your
proposals.

If you haven't gotten your ticket yet, [go ahead and get
registered][register]. If we accept your proposal and you already
bought a ticket, [let us know][email] and we'll refund the ticket
right away.
