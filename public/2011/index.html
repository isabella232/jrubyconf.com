We fixed record numbers of bugs and introduced C extensions and 1.9 support in the JRuby 1.6.x series. We've started integrating Java 7's invokedynamic throughout JRuby. And we're seeing new users faster than ever before, coming from both the Ruby and Java worlds. This talk will update you on JRuby development over the past year, and lay out some rough plans for the year to come.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">09:45A &ndash; 10:00A</div><div class="break">Break</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">10:00a &ndash; 10:30a</div><div class="name">A JRuby Tale</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Marc Peabody</div><div class="description"><p>Hear the story of a JRuby project approaching its completion date from a Java veteran who turned to Ruby for its power and elegance. Find out why JRuby was chosen for some parts of the project and not for others. What were our greatest pain points? How long did the project take? Why was management willing to take on the risk of a new technology? This talk is geared for the IT team just starting out with JRuby who wants to be better prepared for the journey ahead.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">10:40a &ndash; 11:10a</div><div class="name">JRuby and Rails in the JVM</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Tyler Jennings</div><div class="description"><p>This talk will cover JRuby integration with Java and running Rails in the JVM, concluding with the port of a simple Struts / Hibernate app to Rails. The audience should leave with all the knowledge necessary to port their own applications to Rails.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">11:20a &ndash; 11:50A</div><div class="name">JRuby at LinkedIn</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Baq Haidri</div><div class="description"><p>The ubiquity of Java is a testament to the language's design: platform independent object-oriented programming with garbage collection, native multi-threading, process security and static typing.  But is it the best language for programming modern web applications?   Creating impactful social experiences for users involves a constant process of designing, redesigning and testing the interface.  When you write up and tear down code on a daily basis, it helps to have a concise, dynamic and full-featured language like Ruby to evolve a website.  But bringing Ruby to an already existing development and operational infrastructure based on Java is not easy.  It's far easier to bring the JVM to the Ruby and that's what JRuby can do; this talk will cover how we integrated JRuby into a pre-existing Java MVC framework to rapidly iterate on and deliver new experiences to our users.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">11:50a &ndash; 01:00p</div><div class="name">Lunch</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Hot Buffet</div><div class="description"><ul><li>Tossed Salad with Assorted Dressings</li><li>Freshly Baked Rolls with Soft Butter</li><li>Boneless Chicken Cacciatore</li><li>Blackened Pork Loin with Papaya Salsa</li><li>Roasted Corn and Carrots</li><li>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</li><li>Assortment of Specialty Cakes and Pies</li><li>Fresh Brewed Regular and Decaffeinated Coffe and Iced Tea</li><li>Assorted Diet and Regular Soft Drinks and Bottled Water</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">01:00p &ndash; 02:10p</div><div class="break">Lightning Talks</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">02:20p &ndash; 02:50p</div><div class="name">Why I Love TorqueBox (And Why You Will Too)</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Benjamin Browning</div><div class="description"><p>This talk will introduce you to TorqueBox and why you should consider it for your next JRuby application. We'll cover TorqueBox features -messaging, scheduled jobs, asynchronous tasks, and services - then show how they can save you time and effort during development and deployment. We'll also show how you can use dependency injection in Ruby to integrate with existing Java components in a way no other JRuby server can.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">02:50p &ndash; 03:20p</div><div class="break">Break</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">03:30p &ndash; 04:00p</div><div class="name">Semantic Web and JRuby</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Carin Meier</div><div class="description"><p>The Semantic Web is changing the way we communicate and share data on the internet and holds the key to exciting new innovations.  Come and discover what the Semantic Web is and it's many benefits.  We'll learn about some of the technologies that enable the Semantic Web (RDF/ SPARQL) and take a look at using the power of JRuby to access Jena, a prominent Java Open Source Semantic Web Framework,  to do some practical examples.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">04:15p &ndash; 05:00P</div><div class="name">Keynote: Your Software Is Alive</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Michael Feathers</div><div class="description"><p>As developers, we love order.  When systems are orderly, they are easy to understand and maintain. But, if that's the case, shouldn't our systems be neat, symmetric, nice and orderly?  After all, we are in control -- we write the code.  In this keynote, Michael Feathers will talk about how we need to change our expectations of software design, learning how to guide code's growth rather than trying to dictate it.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="day_2" class="schedule_days copy_block"><h1>Thursday, August 4, 2011</h1><div class="entry"><div class="time">09:00a &ndash; 09:45a</div><div class="name">Keynote: Never Settle</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Justin Gehtland</div><div class="description"><p>The tools you use, and the way you work, are important. Your ability to do the best work you can is tied to the choices you make on technology, process, and lifestyle.  Compromising on these things isn't a tradeoff; its a death blow.  This talk is part history, part prescription, and all opinionated.  Do that which you love, and success may follow.  Do that which you despise, and it surely won't.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">09:45A &ndash; 10:00A</div><div class="break">Break</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">10:00a &ndash; 10:30a</div><div class="name">Eloquent JRuby</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Russ Olsen</div><div class="description"><p>JRuby shows that you can mix Java and Ruby together to get something great. But there are lots of Java things -- from coding conventions to static typing -- that don't translate well into Ruby. In this session, we'll talk about writing idiomatic Ruby code, code that will work both on the JVM and in the heads of Rubyists without causing either to catch fire.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">10:40a &ndash; 11:10a</div><div class="name">Building the MagicWebService</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Jason Gilman</div><div class="description"><p>The NASA ECHO project needed to build a REST API on top of an existing SOAP API with ~200 available operations.  They chose JRuby and Rails to build the API.  The first implementation of the SOAP request layer using an existing Ruby library suffered from poor performance and code bloat.  They solved these problems by creating the MagicWebService.  The MagicWebService uses an existing Java library for fast performance and metaprogramming tricks to make a dead simple Ruby API.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">11:20a &ndash; 11:50A</div><div class="name">Big Data and JRuby</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Jeremy Hinegardner</div><div class="description"><p>"Big Data" is a hot topic these days, and encountering "Big Data" issues and the complexity around them, is a more common occurrence today than it was even a couple of years ago.  Understanding what is meant by "Big Data" and some of the tools around it is something every developer should know a little about. Along these lines, One of the amazing things that we benefit from, as developers who use JRuby, is the existing ecosystem of Java libraries and platforms for manipulating Big Data. The most famous, and probably of the most immediate use to rubyists is Hadoop and the Hadoop ecosystem of projects. This talk will touch on "Big Data" and how we, as developers who use Ruby, may be use JRuby within a variety of Hadoop and Hadoop related projects such as HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, Hive, Zookeeper, etc.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">11:50a &ndash; 01:00p</div><div class="name">Lunch</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Hot Buffet</div><div class="description"><ul><li>Tossed Salad with Assorted Dressings</li><li>Freshly Baked Rolls with Soft Butter</li><li>Lime Marinated Flank Steak with Cilantro-Tomatoe Relish</li><li>Cornmeal Fried Catfish</li><li>Green Beans</li><li>Rice Pilaf</li><li>Assortment of Specialty Cakes and Pies</li><li>Fresh Brewed Regular and Decaffeinated Coffe and Iced Tea</li><li>Assorted Diet and Regular Soft Drinks and Bottled Water</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">01:00p &ndash; 01:30p</div><div class="name">Trinidad is Still My Name</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">David Calevera</div><div class="description"><p>Trinidad has become the default application server to use with JRuby. It takes the best features of Apache Tomcat and brings them to the Ruby world. In this session we'll talk about its features, about deamons, easy and reliable deployments, extensions and hidden secrets that make this server so special. But we'll also talk about ideas, people and motivations, about why this project was started and why people choose it among other options.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">01:40p &ndash; 02:10p</div><div class="break">TBA</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">02:20p &ndash; 02:50p</div><div class="name">Cross Platform Desktop Apps with JRuby</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Daniel Lucraft</div><div class="description"><p>With modern JRuby tools and Java gui toolkits, we can write desktop apps easily and deploy them using gems. In this talk, we'll discuss how to integrate a Java graphics toolkit into your JRuby project, and show how we've managed hundreds of Java class imports. We'll show how to use Cucumber to run integration tests of the app, and how to use Rubygems to distribute your app across 3 platform.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">02:50p &ndash; 03:20p</div><div class="break">Break</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">03:30p &ndash; 04:00p</div><div id="super_long_title" class="name">JRuby, Not Just for Hard-Headed Pragmatists</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Ian Dees</div><div class="description"><p>JRuby bills itself as the pragmatic Ruby, the go-to implementation when you need to fit into the Java universe or support a ton of platforms.  Who knew it was also a tool for having fun exploring the realms of computer science? Want to invent your own programming language?  With libraries like BiteScript, you can begin on familiar Ruby ground and concentrate on the language, letting the JVM handle things like object allocation. Want to play with different concurrency models?  With JRuby, you can connect to the ones from Clojure or Scala, or even dip into the source code and invent your own. In this talk, we'll discuss how JRuby can be your springboard into the joy of computing.</p></div></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="time">04:15p &ndash; 05:00P</div><div class="name">Keynote: Abstraction Distractions</div><div class="more"><div class="speaker">Neal Ford</div><div class="description"><p>Computer science is built on a shaky tower of abstractions, but we've been distracted by other things until we believe it is reality. This talk teases apart some of the tangled abstractions that have become so common they are invisible yet impact important decisions.
